# nddev-device-sync-server working contract

This public AGPL-3.0-only repository owns the generic Rust control-plane
server. It must remain independently self-hostable and must never contain
private estate topology, production endpoints, secrets, real telemetry or
organization policy.

Read `standarts.lock` and the pinned protocol/core versions before editing.
Keep domain/application logic in the core module, wire contracts in the
protocol module and server I/O in adapters. Every endpoint needs structured
telemetry, correlation, timeout behavior and a focused test.
