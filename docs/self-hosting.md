# Direct HTTPS alpha foundation

The application terminates TLS using Rust/rustls. No reverse proxy, CDN, HTTP
cache, certificate issuance service or backup/recovery job is included. DNS-only
records and a publicly trusted certificate belong to the operator. Reachability
from a region must be measured there; direct DNS cannot guarantee routing.

## Configuration

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NDS_SERVER_ADDR` | Listener, defaults to loopback `127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `DATABASE_URL_FILE` | Runtime PostgreSQL URL, from a mounted secret file |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Alternative for local development; never configure both forms |
| `NDS_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL_FILE` | Separate migration credential; read only by `migrate` |
| `NDS_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Alternative migration secret for local development |
| `NDS_TLS_CERT_FILE`, `NDS_TLS_KEY_FILE` | PEM certificate chain and matching private key; both required to enable HTTPS |
| `NDS_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | Accepted connection tasks including TLS handshakes; default 256, range 1–4096 |
| `NDS_MAX_REQUESTS` | Active handlers across all connections; default 64, range 1–1024 |
| `NDS_ENVIRONMENT` | Non-secret deployment label for every local event; default `self-hosted` |
| `NDS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | Exact HTTPS service origin used to verify signed device requests |
| `NDS_WEB_ROOT` | Optional absolute path to an immutable browser artifact with `nds-assets.json`; absent means API-only serving |
| `NDS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Optional operator-owned collector origin for native OTLP/HTTP traces; no credentials in the URL |

Absent TLS configuration enables HTTP for local development. A partial or invalid
pair fails startup; there is no fallback from failed TLS to plaintext. Production
must set both files. Database URLs are redacted in Debug; errors exclude SQLx
messages, secret contents and TLS paths. Secret URL files are limited to 16 KiB.
TLS files are bounded to 256 KiB (chain) and 16 KiB (key), with a five-second load
deadline. Use trusted local regular files, readable only by their service users.

Runtime startup never executes migrations. It rejects a role with superuser,
role/database creation or `public` schema creation privileges. The runtime
identity needs access only to application tables. `/v1/ready` checks the baseline
schema record as well as connectivity; an unmigrated database is not ready.

Run `nddev-device-sync-server migrate` explicitly before `serve`. Migrations have
a sixty-second deadline and a separate credential. The Compose initializer
creates `nds_migrator` (schema owner) and `nds_runtime`. The baseline grants
metadata reads; the identity migration grants bootstrap-owner insertion,
challenge/rate-state mutations and session insertion/deletion. Runtime cannot
reassign the owner, modify the SQLx ledger or create schema objects.
Enrollment adds device insertion/status updates and bounded challenge state.
Session writers, revocation, observed expiry and enrollment authorization share
one bounded PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock. Runtime has no session UPDATE
grant and cannot extend expiry or alter a stored session binding.
Device rows have no runtime DELETE grant, preserving revoked identities.
Administrative access stays with PostgreSQL; observability credentials are not
provisioned until the observability service exists.

## Compose template

`compose.yaml` creates isolated application/database networks, a PostgreSQL 18
named volume, a one-shot migration service and the non-root HTTPS server. Only
HTTPS is published. Application and PostgreSQL run with read-only root filesystems,
no Linux capabilities, bounded CPU/memory/processes, bounded local logs and health
checks. The data volume is live storage, with no backup or recovery service.

Prepare an operator-owned directory outside the source checkout with five files:

- `postgres_admin_password`, `postgres_migrator_password`, `postgres_runtime_password`:
  distinct generated passwords;
- `migration_database_url`: `postgres://nds_migrator:<encoded-password>@postgres/nds`;
- `runtime_database_url`: `postgres://nds_runtime:<encoded-password>@postgres/nds`.

Passwords inside URLs must be percent-encoded. Do not put secrets in command
arguments, `.env` files, Git or logs. Compose file secrets are bind-mounted, so
host ownership/mode must permit UID 999 to read PostgreSQL password files and UID
10001 to read each app URL file. Verify permissions without printing contents.
Role initialization occurs only on an empty database volume. Changed secret
files do not automatically rotate database roles. Never delete a volume to
repair credentials or re-run initialization.

Set non-secret deployment inputs outside Git:

```sh
export NDS_IMAGE='registry.example.invalid/nds/server@sha256:<reviewed-image-digest>'
export NDS_SOURCE_COMMIT='<full-source-commit>'
export NDS_PUBLIC_HOST='sync.example.invalid'
export NDS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN='https://sync.example.invalid'
export NDS_HTTPS_BIND='0.0.0.0'
export NDS_SECRETS_DIRECTORY='/operator-owned/secrets'
export NDS_TLS_DIRECTORY='/operator-owned/tls'
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up -d
```

The template defaults to publishing on loopback until an operator chooses a
public bind address. Its container healthcheck validates the certificate hostname
and chain (never `curl -k`). Local integration with a private CA must explicitly
mount that CA and configure curl's trust bundle. For a development build, supply
a local `NDS_IMAGE` tag, a full `NDS_SOURCE_COMMIT`, and run `docker compose build`.
Release deployments must instead consume the reviewed built image by digest.

The server exposes `/v1/health`, `/v1/ready`, `/source` and the implemented v2
identity/device routes, with request IDs and `Cache-Control: no-store`. Identity is
unavailable until configured privately. `/v1/ready` requires schema version 13;
use the explicit migrator before starting the updated runtime. The observability
pipeline remains a separate slice.

## Owner identity

Set `NDS_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE` to an operator-owned JSON file, at most 16 KiB.
For Compose, use `compose.yaml` plus `compose.identity.yaml` and set
`NDS_AUTH_DIRECTORY`; the overlay mounts this directory read-only at
`/run/nds-auth`. Paths inside the JSON refer to readable files in that mount.
Protect it from unrelated users and never put the file or secrets in Git.

For automatic native vault provisioning, configure `NDS_VAULT_KEK_FILE` with a
distinct canonical unpadded base64url 32-byte wrapping key outside PostgreSQL.
The identity overlay reads `/run/nds-auth/vault_kek`; prepare that regular file
privately with mode `0600` or `0400` and ownership readable by UID 10001. Symlinks
and group/world-readable files are rejected. Never reuse the identity pepper or
silently replace this wrapping key. No backup or recovery mechanism is created.
`/v2/vault/key` rechecks the session, device signature, nonce and active device
under the same transaction used by revocation. An existing client root registers
once; another key cannot replace its established binding. The server has
decryption authority, so this model is not client-only E2EE. Native HTTPS request
and response bodies contain privileged key material and must not be recorded.

| JSON field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `owner_email` | Explicit permitted ASCII mailbox; trim and lowercase comparison |
| `pepper_file` | Separate file containing canonical unpadded base64url of 32 cryptographically random bytes |
| `smtp` | Optional object: `host`, `port`, `tls`, `from`; optional paired `username` and `password_file` |
| `smtp.tls` | `tls` for implicit TLS, `starttls` for mandatory STARTTLS, or `loopback` only for literal loopback relay addresses |
| `github` | Optional object: stable numeric `owner_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret_file`, `callback_url` |
| `github.callback_url` | Exact HTTPS URL ending in `/v2/auth/github/callback`, without user info, query or fragment |

At least one provider must be configured. SMTP ports are configurable, including
implicit TLS on 2465 for providers supporting it. External relays always require
TLS certificate validation. The GitHub adapter only calls fixed github.com and
api.github.com endpoints and never follows redirects. Its provider access token
exists only for the bounded code exchange and identity read.

Bootstrap creates one persistent internal user/tenant identity from this private
configuration. A later different email/pepper/GitHub binding fails startup;
runtime cannot silently reassign the owner. Configure both desired bindings
before initial startup. Provider linking or credential rotation requires a
separate reviewed operation. Public registration is absent.

Email challenges use eight-digit codes, five-minute expiry, five attempts and
a sixty-second resend delay. A permitted resend invalidates the previous code.
Subject limits allow 32 challenges/hour and source limits ten starts/fifteen
minutes. Source identity uses the socket IP; forwarding headers and ephemeral
ports cannot change it. Store protected HMAC verifiers, never plaintext codes.
Responses are generic for permitted and other valid mailboxes. SMTP uses a
sixteen-item memory queue and an eight-second delivery deadline, with no retry
of an uncertain delivery. Required local failures remain visible. Provider
acceptance is not proof of mailbox delivery.

GitHub flows last five minutes, are bounded to 128 and disappear on process
restart. After stable provider ID verification, the browser shows the same
comparison code as the initiating app. An explicit approval requires its
one-use HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookie, CSRF proof and exact origin. GET callback
alone never approves an initiating app. The app polls at most once every two
seconds and consumes its opaque exchange capability once. An interrupted or
failed exchange may require starting sign-in again.

All three methods issue the same eight-hour owner session; at most 32 active sessions
are retained per user. Session digests persist in PostgreSQL; GET `/v2/session` validates
ownership/expiry and DELETE revokes the current session. Vault delivery additionally requires active enrolled device proof; a session
does not regenerate lost device or vault keys. Expired challenge/session/rate state is pruned on
identity activity within fixed table capacities. Pending SMTP work is discarded
on shutdown; already-delivered unexpired OTP verifiers survive restart under
the unchanged pepper.

`Accept-Language: en` or `ru` on the initial request selects email and approval
text, defaulting to English. The locale is bound to the pending flow. Anonymous
`/v2/auth/methods` reads cached OTP/GitHub provider readiness: bounded
startup/background checks, sixty-second refresh and failure backoff capped at
five minutes. Passkey availability additionally queries registered owner
credentials. Stale provider readiness becomes unavailable. GitHub readiness is
not evidence of a successful credential/owner exchange; prove that with an
actual sign-in.
Authentication requires HTTPS unless the HTTP listener is loopback-only.

## Device identity

An authenticated owner requests `/v2/devices/challenges` with platform, display
name and the per-installation public Ed25519 key. Native secure storage owns the
private key. The server rejects malformed, noncanonical, weak and non-prime-order
public keys before allocating a challenge. Proof signs the exact protocol
domain prefix and decoded 32-byte challenge; `/v2/devices/enrollments` requires
the same initiating session, rechecked and locked inside the database transaction.
A challenge lasts at most five minutes and no longer than that session, allows
five attempts and is consumed once. Expired or exhausted proof cannot revive.

Per-user bounds are eight pending challenges, 32 active devices and 128
retained device identities. Authenticated enrollment allows 32 starts per hour
per owner, separately from the unauthenticated sign-in source budget. Terminal challenge rows are discarded on new
enrollment activity. Device rows persist: revocation is terminal for that public
key, and retained-identity exhaustion fails closed until a separately reviewed
lifecycle change exists. No automatic pruning or key rotation is implemented.

GET `/v2/devices` returns owned devices including revoked ones and an opaque
cursor. The requested limit is 1–100; each response contains at most 32 items
to bound encoded size even for maximal Unicode names. DELETE
`/v2/devices/{device_id}` is idempotent for an owned device and retains its row.
If a completion response is uncertain, retain the local key and inspect the
owned device list. Enrollment establishes device identity. Subsequent encrypted
sync and vault-key delivery require both an active owner session and signed,
nonce-protected requests from that unrevoked device; neither authentication nor
enrollment alone substitutes for the other proof.

## Certificate renewal and shutdown

The operator owns issuance, renewal and expiry monitoring. Mount the parent TLS
directory, containing `current/fullchain.pem` and `current/privkey.pem`, read-only
into the application. Under the issuer's update lock, validate and replace the
active matching pair, then signal the application only after both files are
complete. Keep keys readable by application UID/GID 10001 and not by unrelated
users. A `current` symlink may point to the active directory within this mount;
do not retain old certificate generations as recovery copies. Mounting a
single file would retain the old inode after replacement. The application's
last valid configuration remains only in memory if a reload is rejected.

On Unix, signal the running service after replacement:

```sh
docker compose kill --signal SIGHUP nddev-sync-server
```

The reload has a five-second deadline. A valid pair is atomically published for
new handshakes; existing connections continue. A failed pair keeps the last valid
configuration and emits `tls.reload.failed`; fix the pair and signal again.
There is no periodic polling, unbounded retry queue, or certificate acquisition.
On non-Unix systems use a controlled restart after validating both files.

TLS handshakes have a five-second deadline. HTTP/1 header reads have a ten-second
deadline, HTTP/2 concurrent streams are capped at 64, and idle HTTP/2 peers have
bounded keepalive checks. Handlers have the existing fifteen-second deadline.
SIGTERM/Ctrl+C stops accepting and drains for at most twenty seconds, then closes
remaining connections. Compose allows twenty-five seconds before forced exit.

Admission has no application wait queue. At connection capacity, an accepted
socket closes before a TLS handshake or connection task is created. At handler
capacity, requests receive `503 server_busy`, `Retry-After: 1`, correlation and
`no-store`; clients must use bounded backoff. Permits return on completion,
disconnect, timeout or failed handshake. Pressure events aggregate rejection
counts at the first rejection, powers of two and recovery; rejected HTTP
requests still emit their normal error events. These bounds complement container
limits. Streaming handlers must define their own body lifetime bounds before
they are introduced.

## Local logging

The immutable shared SDK owns one flat JSON envelope, including startup failures,
migrations, TLS reload and shutdown. Version/channel/standards/environment
labels permit only 1–128 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores and hyphens.
Normal logging is the default. `RUST_LOG` does not enable dependency dumps.
Local logs and real OpenTelemetry contexts remain available when telemetry
export is disabled. With `NDS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and enabled export, the shared SDK
sends actual native spans to the operator-owned collector. Its admission queue,
HTTP deadline, retries and shutdown are bounded; arbitrary vendor tracestate,
events, links and error prose are removed before export. Collector credentials
remain in the central pipeline. `NDS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` is operator intent, not
a delivery receipt; no configured endpoint means no native trace egress.

Each emitted record carries a per-process `producer.instance_id` and ordered
`producer.sequence` assigned under the SDK sink lock. Filtered events do not
consume sequence numbers. The optional pair is omitted after the exact JSON
integer limit instead of wrapping. Gaps can expose discontinuity; they do not
alone prove an exact dropped-event count.

The SDK accepts only owned targets and canonical schema fields, with a 16 KiB
record limit. Its stdout queue holds at most 128 events; saturation drops events
without blocking request execution. SDK counters and periodic process heartbeats
report local loss when the sink can write again. Shutdown waits at most one
second for the output worker; a blocked sink may leave output incomplete. Neither
an accepted queue entry nor process exit proves external delivery. This bounded
queue replaces the former synchronous server formatter.

For a diagnostic window, explicitly set `NDS_LOG_MODE=debug`,
`NDS_DEBUG_SCOPE=http|transport|database`, and `NDS_DEBUG_SECONDS=1..900`.
`NDS_DEBUG_EVENT_LIMIT` defaults to 1000, with a supported range of 1–10000.
The process automatically returns to normal at expiry or budget exhaustion;
enable/disable transitions include scope and reason. Debug adds only named
events with bounded fields, never bodies, credentials or raw URLs. Both modes
use the bounded Compose log retention. Remove all `NDS_DEBUG_*` settings when
setting `NDS_LOG_MODE=normal`; contradictory settings fail startup safely.

## Authenticated client observability

Mount a private owner-only JSON file and set `NDS_OBSERVABILITY_CONFIG_FILE` to
its path to enable the signed client gateway. Its fields are `origin` (the
internal observability service origin), `trace_origin` (the internal Vector OTLP
HTTP origin), `ingest_token_file` and `admin_token_file`. Configuration and token
files must be regular files with no group/other permissions; symlinks are refused.
HTTP origins are allowed only for the operator-owned internal network; public
clients still use the control plane's authenticated HTTPS origin. No collector
credential reaches a client, and callers cannot supply proxy destinations.

The gateway binds owner/device identity, consumes signed nonces, validates closed
redacted batches and caps forwarding at four concurrent requests with five-second
deadlines. It forwards native OTLP protobuf after attaching verified ownership.
Both server and collector export opt-out apply to client feeds. Transport receipts
do not establish searchable delivery; qualify the actual OpenObserve result.
Without the private configuration the gateway reports unavailable.

`GET /v2/observability/client-policy` exposes only `export_mode` to an active,
signed client. Global status, incidents and incident actions require the immutable
configured bootstrap operator identity. A company administrator does not gain
these privileges. A valid non-operator receives `403 authorization_denied` and
retains its ordinary session; ingestion and client policy remain available.

## Passkeys and schema 8

Configure `NDS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` with the exact HTTPS origin and a DNS host, alongside
PostgreSQL and private owner identity configuration. That host becomes the RP ID;
IP-only origins do not enable the passkey service. Native clients open the server
browser ceremony, compare its code with the initiating app and explicitly approve
registration/authentication. WebAuthn requires user verification and consumes a
bounded, single-use challenge. Registration requires an authenticated session
issued within five minutes. Passkey sign-in is unavailable until the owner has
registered a credential; it does not create an owner or bypass other methods.


Schema 8 links newly issued passkey sessions to their credential. An owner can
list fingerprints/creation times and revoke a credential through authenticated
routes. Removal requires a session issued in the last five minutes and rechecks
it under the mutation lock. Associated sessions are removed by the same database
transaction; legacy unlinked passkey sessions are also revoked on a removal.
Existing sessions are preserved during migration. Vault/device keys are unchanged.
A session issued in the future relative to server time cannot authorize credential
changes. Losing/removing every authenticator does not introduce recovery flows;
the accepted email/GitHub methods retain their existing owner policy.

## Browser sessions and schema 9

Schema 9 adds browser device enrollment to the existing signed operation protocol.
Browser application requests explicitly select the same-origin cookie adapter with
`X-NDS-Client: browser`. Session issuance uses a Secure/HttpOnly host-only cookie;
request-origin checks and device proof remain independent. Native bearer clients
retain their wire format. Qualify updated native clients that understand the `web`
platform before enrolling browser devices. This adapter is not the Flutter web
artifact or proof of browser offline/storage qualification.

Passkey registration and removal require authentication within the existing
five-minute window. A valid older session receives `403 recent_authentication_required`
for these actions and remains usable for ordinary session and vault operations.

The optional web artifact is served on this same origin. Its manifest contains
`schema_version: 1` and a `files` array of relative `path`, lowercase SHA-256
`sha256` and exact `bytes`. Startup verifies and loads only those files, requires
`index.html`, and fails on mismatch; extra filesystem files are never served.
Limits are 4096 entries, 64 MiB per file and 128 MiB total. Keep the artifact
directory operator-owned and immutable while the process starts. Replace it
only through an explicitly reviewed artifact update and process restart.
API paths have no HTML fallback. CSP restricts executable and network resources
to this origin; source maps and runtime credentials are not web assets.

## Sync lifecycle and schema 11

The explicit migrator renames the four sync tables to `public.nds_replica_*`
and projects bounded history metadata from the existing original bytes. It
preserves request/result bodies, fingerprints and statuses. Invalid historical
bindings abort the migration. No history is deleted during migration.

Every owner initially admits new wire-version-2 operations. Retained authorized
replays keep their original status and bytes. `/v3/sync` reports the owner's
admission version; history/base endpoints preserve original operation strings.
These wire versions are internal contracts of the same NDS alpha.

Admission version 3 requires separate qualification of the deployed readers and
writers before an explicit operator transition. The runtime cannot change that
column and exposes no activation endpoint. Only then can Core select history
retirement under the existing 16K-operation/256MiB/4096-entity limits. Missing
legacy outcomes and expired basis/cursor/checkpoint are explicit refusals, never
replacement operations or success receipts. Commit telemetry is emitted only
after the database confirms the transaction.

Readiness requires schema 13. The old SQL table names no longer exist; stop old
server writers before deploying this schema. Build/unit and ordinary isolated
PostgreSQL tests do not establish old-binary exclusion, lost-commit-acknowledgement
handling or physical storage-failure qualification. Qualify those deployment
boundaries separately before activation; source inclusion does not authorize a
live migration or retention change.

## Owned screen control and schema 10

Schema 10 adds current endpoint binding rows and finite screen intent/receipt
rows. Apply the append-only migration with the existing migrator credential;
Current readiness requires schema13. The runtime role has only the needed
SELECT/INSERT, binding transition and view state/grant UPDATE, and expired-view
DELETE privileges. It cannot change owner/session references, original request,
profile/admission/expiry, delete binding CAS history or perform DDL/TRUNCATE.

`/v2/rds` exposes only the canonical binding, bind, create, incoming, view, ready
and end operations from Protocol17. Every call reuses current owner session,
enrolled-device HTTP signatures and fresh nonce consumption under the existing
identity transaction lock. Endpoint registration additionally verifies strict
canonical non-weak Ed25519 endpoint possession against Core PoP V2 before replay.
The consuming client must provide an Accounts-owned protected purpose key and
enforce local host opt-in, LocalUseFence and platform source access. These are
client-owned requirements; this server slice does not claim that Accounts or
shared-client integration is implemented or accepted.

There is one binding row per enrolled device, retained for revision CAS. Views
retain at most64 rows per owner; each has a <=64KiB original request, <=2KiB
public projection and <=8KiB opaque native artifact. No private keys, frames,
locators, native allowlists or capture consent are stored. The retained projection
contains no original viewer-session digest. Ready is an artifact state, not a
received/decoded/presented frame.

Early End frees the active participant slot and clears the artifact, while the
original receipt occupies the cap until its original finite expiry. Exact create
replay returns the current terminal state with original id/profile/admission/
expiry; it never returns an ended intent to Requested. Only NEW create checks
the64row cap; authorized replay, Ready, End and revoke do not. Cleanup runs under
the same authorizing transaction using its persisted clock floor, deleting only
expired rows. No live eviction, renewal or expiry movement occurs. After cleanup,
absent/unowned End both return authorization_denied; no historical registry is
retained to promise indefinite204. End before expiry requires the current owner
and an active signed viewer/host participant, without requiring the original
viewer session, old binding or live native grant.

The owning PostgreSQL/SMTP gate uses fresh enrollment and independent OpenSSL
HTTP/endpoint signatures, tests races, exact artifact/receipt replay, cap, expiry,
clock floor, session/device revocation, timeout and runtime privileges. Its opaque
server artifact fixture is not claimed to be a valid native grant. To additionally
exercise schema9-to13 with a preserved schema9 server binary outside this checkout,
the optional upgrade fixture requires `cryptography==50.0.2` in its Python
environment. It uses real AES-256-GCM for seven bounded existing rows in owner,
device, session, vault envelope, sync counter/entity/operation tables. Canonical
original data columns and digests are checked after migration13 and its repeat; envelope
and record decryption remain valid. These are isolated storage witnesses, not
fabricated authenticated NDS sessions. The existing real HTTP/PG/SMTP checks
run after scoped witness cleanup:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-postgres.py --fixture-passkeys --upgrade-from /ABS/PREVIOUS_SERVER21_BINARY
```

This gate owns ephemeral PostgreSQL/SMTP only and does not deploy or establish
native capture, protected Accounts storage or shared Flutter runtime acceptance.

## Company identity and schema 12

The existing tenant becomes a company and the configured bootstrap owner becomes
its administrator. User, tenant, device, key-envelope and encrypted-operation
identities remain unchanged; only the obsolete singleton column is removed.
Each user belongs to one company. Existing eligible OTP challenges are bound to
the established bootstrap principal without changing their verifier or expiry.

`POST /v2/auth/invitations/challenges` accepts email, invitation ID and protected
link possession, then uses the ordinary email verification endpoint. Link
possession alone creates neither a member nor a session. Acceptance rechecks
current inviting authority, intended recipient, expiry and status in the same
transaction as activation and session creation. Reinvitation retains the original
user/Vault binding and invalidates all prior sessions. Normal sign-in, personal
sync, device actions and passkey mutations check current active membership.
Role alone never grants another user's Vault, credentials or GDS stream.

Passkey login accepts an email account selector. Omission is accepted only when
there is exactly one active account. Registration uses its authenticated session
and rejects a selector. Neither email selection nor global method availability
is proof of user verification. WebAuthn credential proof is still required.

The company administration API is described below. Native/web presentation,
invitation-fragment handling, cross-user RDS and multiple-user WebAuthn browser
acceptance remain separate work. Source inclusion does not establish completion
of those clients or authorize deployment.

With `cryptography==50.0.2`, add `--upgrade-company` to the PostgreSQL gate to
exercise production 11-to12-to13 SQL in a separate disposable database. Existing
encrypted witnesses remain decryptable and old OTP state is preserved. This
supplements fresh SQLx migration/repeat checks; it does not authorize deployment.

## Company administration and schema 13

All company routes require a current session and enrolled-device HTTP signature.
`GET /v2/company` returns the caller's company and membership. Active company
administrators can page `/v2/company/members` and `/v2/company/invitations`, create
an invitation with POST to the latter, revoke it through
`/v2/company/invitations/{invitation_id}/revoke`, and change/remove a member through
`POST /v2/company/members/{user_id}`. Callers cannot select another company.

Mutations carry a canonical UUIDv7 `operation_id`; its timestamp fixes a
five-minute retry window, with at most sixty seconds of future clock skew.
Retries retain exact body bytes and target but use a fresh signature/nonce.
Current authority is checked before replaying the original status/body; another
request under that ID conflicts. The expired ID remains invalid after receipt
cleanup or restart. Up to128 receipts per device are retained, each at most4KiB.
Member changes also require the observed revision and atomically preserve the
last active administrator. Removal revokes sessions and enrollment challenges,
retires affected server screen metadata and retains personal keys/data. Demotion
revokes outstanding invitations issued by that administrator and removes only
administrative cross-user screen authority.

Company pages contain at most50 items. Each company admits up to128 pending
invitations and retains at most1024 invitation records. Invitations expire after
seven days; cleanup keeps a five-minute grace and never removes a row still
referenced by an OTP challenge. These are control metadata bounds, independent
of repository synchronization limits.

Creation, SMTP acceptance and membership acceptance are separate outcomes. The
immutable creation reply describes initial pending state; GET invitations reads
current state. Only protected token verifiers are durable. The existing finite
SMTP queue holds one-use delivery material, so command replay never resends.
Unavailable queue/transport configuration records `failed`; uncertain SMTP
outcomes or an unacknowledged delivery observed after five minutes record
`unknown`. Neither state implies recipient delivery. An administrator can revoke
and issue a new invitation explicitly; there is no silent token replacement.
Queued mail can arrive after revocation, but recipient authentication always
rechecks current authority, status and expiry.

Links use the configured origin and `#invite/<id>/<token>`, keeping tokens out of
HTTP request targets. Clients must consume and clear that fragment, then perform
the recipient OTP flow; the current presentation does not yet implement this
handoff. Tokens, verifiers and recipient addresses never enter telemetry. Audit
records distinguish creation, acceptance, role changes, removal and delivery;
public command/invitation IDs correlate verified actors and targets with traces.

The ordinary real PostgreSQL/SMTP gate checks signed administrative creation,
actual mail and recipient OTP, concurrent duplicate requests, changed bytes,
restart, cross-company/member denial, pagination, concurrent last-admin changes,
session/screen-metadata retirement and real five-minute command expiration.
Separate real collector/native-client qualification proves operator restriction
and ordinary client policy without disabling authentication or telemetry.
